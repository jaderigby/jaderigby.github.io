# Instant Pot Chili #

## Ingredients ##

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 2 green bell peppers, seeded and diced
- 2 fresh cayenne peppers, chopped (seeds included)
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano leaves
- 1 lb ground turkey
- 1/4 cup of your favorite hot sauce
- 1 (15oz) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 1 (15oz) can kidney beans, including their liquid

## Directions ##

1. Set the pressure cooker to its “Sauté” setting and add the oil. Add the onions, peppers, and garlic, and sauté until the onions soften and begin to brown, about 10 minutes.

2. Add the cumin and oregano and sauté two more minutes, until aromatic.

3. Add the ground beef, breaking it up with a spoon or spatula. Sauté until opaque and cooked through, about 5 minutes.

4. Add the hot sauce, canned tomatoes and kidney beans and stir to combine. Cover the pressure cooker, then set it to the “Bean/Chili” setting.

5. When the pressure cooker is done cooking and has depressurized, remove the lid, then ladle chili into bowls and serve hot.

6. Top with grated cheese and cilantro, and serve with rice or cornbread, if desired.
