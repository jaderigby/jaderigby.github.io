## Directions ##

1. Wash artichokes and trim stems. Cut off 1 inch from tops and snip off sharp leaf tips.  Brush cut edges with lemon juice.  Cook artichokes, covered, in a large amount of boiling water for 20 to 30 minutes or till a leaf pulls out easily. Invert to drain.  Cool slightly.

2. Meanwhile, in a nonstick skillet, cook mushrooms, onion, and garlic in oil for 3 minutes.  Stir in tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and pepper.  Cook 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Stir in bread crumbs and set aside.

3. Cut each artichoke in half from top to stem.  Remove and discard fuzzy choke.  Spray a shallow 2-quart rectangular baking dish with nonstick coating.  Arrange artichokes, cut side up, in dish.  Spoon tomato mixture into artichoke halves, mounding slightly on top.  Sprinkle cheese over filling.  Bake in a 350° oven for 15 to 20 minutes or till heated through. Makes 8 servings.
