# Cafe Rio Salad #

## Ingredients ##

__Pork Recipe:__

- 2 1/2 lb. pork loin roast
- 1 cup salsa
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar

__Lime Rice:__

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 1/4 cups rice
- 2 1/4 cups chicken broth
- 1/4 teaspoon salt (optional; pork roast will add plenty of “salty” flavor)
- pepper
- juice and zest 1 large or 2 small limes
- 2 tablespoons cilantro, chopped
- 1/8 teaspoon cumin

__Creamy Cilantro Dressing:__

- 1 jar (16oz) La Victoria green salsa (or any green salsa with tomatillo as main ingredient)
- 1 package Buttermilk Ranch salad dressing (dry) (I used Western Family Ranch-alot cheaper)
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/2 cup lowfat mayo
- 1/2 cup buttermilk (or regular) (I used powdered buttermilk and water)
- 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves (I loosely chopped them and then measured them)
- 2 cloves garlic (I used dried)
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (I had crushed red pepper)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- 1/4 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 cup sugar

## Directions ##

__Pork:__

Place roast in slow cooker.  Mix salsa and brown sugar and pour over the roast.  Cover and cook on low heat 8-10 hours.  Shred pork with a fork before serving.  Meat is great in salad, burritos, or tacos . . .

__Lime Rice:__

In a skillet, melt butter with rice, add liquid, and other ingredients, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and cook for 20 minutes.

__Creamy Cilantro Dressing:__

Blend all together in blender until smooth and creamy. 1/2 batch fits in the biggest container of the “bullet”.

Optional Guacamole Recipe: 1 large ripe avocado, peeled and seeded, 1/2 tablespoon of lime juice (I used just a little more), 1 tablespoon finely chopped onion, 1/8th teaspoon of salt.  Mash the avocado and stir in remaining ingredients.  Very good! Serving ideas: Make a tortilla bowl or not.  Great both ways.

_Great with tortillla matchsticks: With a pizza cutter, slice 2 medium flour tortillas into very thin matchstick pieces.  Spread on a baking sheet and bake 5-6 minutes at 400 degrees.  Stir.  Return to oven 3-5 minutes more. Matchsticks should be crisp and golden brown.  Cool.  Makes 2 cups._
