- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 Tbsp Cajun seasoning (or to taste)
- 1/2 tsp salt (or to taste) **
- 1 1/2 cups long grain white rice

- 1 tsp worcestershire sauce
- 2 cups chicken broth

### Directions ###

1. Rub shrimp with 1 tsp of Cajun seasoning and set aside.
2. Press 'Saute' and add oil to inner pot of Instant Pot.
3. Add andouille sausage, and cook until browned, about 6 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
4. Add chicken, and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
5. Add shrimp and briefly saute for just a few seconds, adding a teaspoon of oil if required. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
6. Add onions, bell pepper, celery, and garlic. Stir until onion is translucent.  The liquid released from the vegetables should be enough to deglaze the pan.  If it's not, add a few tablespoons of broth to deglaze.
7. Add thyme, Cajun seasoning, salt, rice and stir to coat, about 30 seconds.
8. Stir in tomatoes, worcestershire, chicken broth and bay leaves.  Make sure there's nothing stuck to the bottom of the pan.
9. Stir in the reserved sausage and chicken.  
10. Cook on 'Manual' or 'Pressure Cook' setting for 7 minutes. Make sure steam release handle is in the ‘Sealing’ position.
11. Do a Quick Release and open the Instant Pot.
12. Carefully stir in shrimp.
13. Close the Instant Pot and allow the shrimp to finish cooking in the residual heat for 10 minutes.
14. Open the Instant Pot and add parsley. Gently stir the jambalaya. Garnish with shallots, if using.
