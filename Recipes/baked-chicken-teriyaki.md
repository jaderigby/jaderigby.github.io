1.  In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the cornstarch, cold
    water, sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, ginger and ground black

    Brush chicken with the sauce. Turn pieces over, and brush again.

    bake for another 30 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run
    clear. Brush with sauce every 10 minutes during cooking.
