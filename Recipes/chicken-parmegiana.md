# Chicken Parmigiana #

## Ingredients ##

- 1 egg, beaten
- 2 ounces dry bread crumbs
- 2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 3/4 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
- 2 ounces shredded mozarella cheese
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Seasoning (basil and oregano)

## Directions ##

1. Preheat oven to 350° F. Lightly grease a medium baking sheet.
2. Pour egg into a small shallow bowl. Place bread crumbs in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken into egg, then into the bread crumbs.  Place coated chicken on the prepared baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until no longer pink and juices run clear.
3. Pour 1/2 of the spaghetti sauce into 7×11 inch baking dish.  Place chicken over sauce, and cover with remaining sauce.  Add some basil and oregano.  Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses on top and return to the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
4. Serve over spaghetti noodles and and with fried zucchini slices.
5. Note: I like to fry the noodles briefly in a pan coated with olive oil for a little extra flavor.
