# Bulgogi Beef #

## Ingredients ##

- 1/4 cup Toasted Sesame Oil

- 2 cloves Garlic, minced
- 1 tsp. Black Pepper
- Optional: fresh grated ginger

## Directions ##

1. If putting meat into crock pot, double the marinade recipe and cook on low. Use country style pork ribs or Beef Roast works best.

2. If using as a marinade, add to 1 1/2 lbs very thinly sliced steak.  Let sit for 4 hours or overnight in fridge.  Let sit at room temperature for 30 min. before you saute.
