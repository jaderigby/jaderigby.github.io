## Metadata: What Is It? ##

<div class="swap-wrap">

  <div class="swap">

> Structured information that describes, explains, locates, or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use or manage an information resource.
<cite>&mdash; Wikipedia</cite>

In short, it is data about a file regarding its author, date, and other useful information.

  </div>

  <div class="swap">

> Often times, we rely on file names and folder structure to organize our files, and consider metadata "extra work".  But in reality, metadata can be even more valuable in maintaining and retrieving files than the folder structure that we contain them in.

  </div>
  <div class="swap">

- Most files contain metadata
- Metadata varies from file type to file type
- PSDs contain metadata
- Word docs do, as well

  </div>

#### Though metadata varies from file type to file type, they typically include the following: ####

<section class="half">
  <article>
    <ul>
      <li>Creation Date</li>
      <li>Modified Date</li>
      <li>Author</li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <article>
    <ul>
      <li>Subject</li>
      <li>Keywords</li>
      <li>Comments</li>
    </ul>
  </article>

  </div>

  <div class="swap">

#### __4__ Most Important Metadata Elements To Us: ####

1. Creation Date
2. Modified Date
3. Author
4. Keywords

  </div>

  <div class="swap">

- __Creation Date__ &mdash; Gives us the first view into the creation timeline
- __Modified Date__ &mdash; Gives a sense of relevancy
- __Author__ &mdash; Ownership: Who to ask questions
- __*Keywords__ &mdash; For intelligent searches and linking different assets to the same project (will be covered coming up)

## Metadata: Keywords ##

<div class="swap-wrap">

  <div class="swap">

- Kewords serve as a robust indexing feature
- Like categories, only better!
- Keep specific and succinct, but use as many as seem logical

  </div>

  <div class="swap">

#### Example: ####

- SeroVital
- Neck Cream
- New Years
- Sale
- Landing Page

  </div>

  <div class="swap">

Start from general and go to specific, leaving out the generic, such as "file type" &mdash; These are already part of the file's definition.

  </div>

  <div class="swap">

1. __Product__ &mdash; SeroVital, GF-9, etc
2. __Category__ &mdash; Neck Cream, etc
3. __Campaign__ &mdash; Memorial Day, etc
4. __Classification__ &mdash; Landing Page, Email, etc

__Note:__ Reserve Multiple authors for comments section.

  </div>

  <div class="swap">

We can continue to refine our conventions, as we see fit.

__Our main goal is retrieving assets without any wasted time whatsoever: To be able to get what we want, and go to work!__
