## Metadata: What Is It? ##

<div class="swap-wrap">

  <div class="swap">

> Often times, we rely on file names and folder structure to organize our files, and consider metadata "extra work".  But in reality, metadata can be even more valuable in maintaining and retrieving files than the folder structure that we contain them in.

  </div>
  <div class="swap">

- Most files contain metadata
- Metadata varies from file type to file type
- PSDs contain metadata
- Word docs do, as well

  </div>

## Metadata Intro: Contâ€™d ##

- Though metadata varies from file type to file type, they typically include the following:
    - Creation Date
    - Modified Date
    - Author
    - Subject
    - Keywords
    - Comments
`

## Metadata: Where? ##

- Metadata is usually listed under "File > Properties" on Macs.
- In Photoshop, it is found under "File > File Info"

## Metadata: Our Main Focus ##

- __4__ Most Important Metadata Elements To Us:
  1. Creation Date
  2. Modified Date
  3. Author
  4. Keywords

## Why These? ##

- __Creation Date__ &mdash; Gives us the first view into the creation timeline
- __Modified Date__ &mdash; Gives a sense of relevancy
- __Author__ &mdash; Ownership: Who to ask questions
- __* Keywords__ &mdash; For intelligent searches and linking different assets to the same project (will be covered coming up)

## Metadata: Keywords ##

  <div class="swap">

- Kewords serve as a robust indexing feature
- Like categories, only better!
- Keep specific and succinct, but use as many as seem logical

  </div>

  <div class="swap">

### Example: ###

- SeroVital
- Neck Cream
- New Years
- Sale
- Landing Page

  </div>

  <div class="swap">

Don't worry about classifications such as file type, etc:  Start from general and go to specific, leaving out the generic, such as "file type" &mdash; These are already part of the file's definition.

  </div>

  <div class="swap">

1. __Product__ &mdash; SeroVital, GF-9, etc
2. __Category__ &mdash; Neck Cream, etc
3. __Campaign__ &mdash; Memorial Day, etc
4. __Classification__ &mdash; Landing Page, Email, etc

__Note:__ Reserve Multiple authors for comments section.

  </div>

  <div class="swap">

We can continue to refine our conventions, as we see fit.

__Our main goal is retrieving assets without any wasted time whatsoever: To be able to get what we want, and go to work!__

### How To Search: ###
